# Deep Learning Specialization Coursera [UPDATED Version 2021]
This repo by [abdur75648](https://github.com/abdur75648) contains all of the solved assignments of Coursera's most famous [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) of 5 courses offered by [deeplearning.ai](www.deeplearning.ai) and taught by [Prof. Andrew Ng](www.andrew.ng)

I'm using only course 5 of this repo and hence have deleted others. [Here's the link to original repo](https://github.com/abdur75648/Deep-Learning-Specialization-Coursera)
